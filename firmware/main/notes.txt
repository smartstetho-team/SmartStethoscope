Audio Sampling Task:
// TODO: This design may change?
// Should we allow users to record new sounds if lets say we finish BLE streaming before
// ML classification? In this case, recorded sounds will be in a queue (complex).

Both BLE and ML classification task will have a ptr to the master audio buffer containing
all the bytes from the recording. 
As long as YOU DO NOT modify the buffer at that address, you should be able to read the data
from both tasks. It is immutable atm. If you need to modify it, use mutexes for thread safety
or use a seperate buffer.

Code comments:

- Use ESP_LOGI for printing.
- If UART driver/hardware is slow compared to the cpu, then there is a chance that
  the print wont come out properly. So you can make the CPU wait until the UART driver
  is done pushing out all the characters on the Tx pin before proceeding. This is equivalent
  to fflush after printf.
  - Force flush after ESP_LOGI --> uart_wait_tx_done(UART_NUM_0, portMAX_DELAY);

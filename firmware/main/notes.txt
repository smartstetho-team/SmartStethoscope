Audio Sampling Task:
// TODO: This design may change?
// Should we allow users to record new sounds if lets say we finish BLE streaming before
// ML classification? In this case, recorded sounds will be in a queue (complex).

Both BLE and ML classification task will have a ptr to the master audio buffer containing
all the bytes from the recording. 
As long as YOU DO NOT modify the buffer at that address, you should be able to read the data
from both tasks. It is immutable atm. If you need to modify it, use mutexes for thread safety
or use a seperate buffer.
